# helm-charts

Collection of signed Helm charts for self-hosted apps. Each chart lives under `charts/<chart>/` with its own `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, `values.schema.json`, `templates/`, and `samples/`.

Charts are distributed via OCI (`ghcr.io/slybase/charts`) and signed with Cosign — see [README-SIGNING.md](README-SIGNING.md).

## Chart structure

- `charts/<chart>/Chart.yaml` — version, appVersion, ArtifactHub annotations (`artifacthub.io/changes`)
- `charts/<chart>/values.yaml` + `values.schema.json` — changes to `values.yaml` must always be reflected in `values.schema.json` (new fields, type changes, removed fields)
- `charts/<chart>/templates/` — Deployment/StatefulSet, Service, Ingress, HPA, PVC, ServiceMonitor
- `charts/<chart>/samples/` — sample values used for installs and doc examples; update alongside template/value changes
- `charts/<chart>/CHANGELOG.md` — human-readable release history

## Release & versioning workflow

Releases are driven by **release-please** + **git tags**, not by hand-editing `version:` in `Chart.yaml`.

1. **Renovate** opens PRs with dependency bumps as conventional commits. The commit type encodes the chart bump (see `renovate.json` packageRules):
   - subchart (`helmv3`) major → `feat` (chart **minor**); subchart minor/patch/digest → `fix` (chart **patch**)
   - direct dep (`helm-values`/`custom.regex`) major → `feat!` breaking (chart **major**); minor → `feat`; patch/digest → `fix`
   - Renovate edits `appVersion` / `artifacthub.io/images` / subchart versions directly, but does **not** touch `version:`.
2. **release-please** (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`, config `release-please-config.json` + `.release-please-manifest.json`) keeps one release PR per chart, bumping `Chart.yaml:version` (via `extra-files`) and generating `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. A bridge step runs `.github/scripts/sync-artifacthub-changes.py` on the release PR to derive the `artifacthub.io/changes` (+ `artifacthub.io/prerelease`) annotation from the new CHANGELOG entry — single source of truth.
4. Merging a release PR creates a per-chart tag (`<chart>-v<version>`, e.g. `wordpress-v4.5.0`) + GitHub Release, which triggers `oci-release.yaml` to package, push, Cosign-sign and upload ArtifactHub metadata.
5. **Auto-merge** (`.github/workflows/release-please-automerge.yml`): release PRs that are **patch or minor** bumps (i.e. not a breaking-major `feat!` and not a `-alpha/-beta/-rc` prerelease) are merged automatically once the ArtifactHub sync commit has landed and all PR checks (`pr-chart-validate.yml`, `chart-install-test.yml`) are green. **Major/breaking releases stay manual.** The merge uses a GitHub App token (`SLYBASE_APP_ID` / `SLYBASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`) — a `GITHUB_TOKEN` merge would not re-trigger release-please, so step 4's tag/OCI chain would never fire. No PR approval is involved: `main` has no required-review protection.

Feature PRs use conventional commits (`feat:`/`fix:`/`feat!:`) the same way to drive their chart's bump. PR validation (lint/template) lives in `pr-chart-validate.yml`.

## WordPress chart

The most complex chart — uses init containers and ConfigMaps/Secrets for plugins, themes, MU-plugins, and custom init scripts. Integrates with MariaDB (subchart or external), Memcached, and Prometheus exporters. See [charts/wordpress/README.md](charts/wordpress/README.md) and [charts/wordpress/samples/](charts/wordpress/samples/).

**Workload controller (`controllerType`):** the chart renders either a Deployment or a StatefulSet:

- `controllerType: deployment` (default, backwards-compatible) — single shared PVC (`pvc.yaml`), suitable for `replicaCount: 1` or RWX storage.
- `controllerType: statefulset` — each replica gets its own ReadWriteOnce volume via `volumeClaimTemplates` (true HA without an RWX share-manager SPOF). Adds a headless Service and `statefulset.*` tunables (`podManagementPolicy`, `updateStrategy`, `persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy`). `storage.existingClaim` is not supported here.

The Pod spec is shared between both controllers via the `wordpress.podTemplate` partial in [templates/_pod.tpl](charts/wordpress/templates/_pod.tpl) — **edit pod-level changes there, not in `deployment.yaml`/`statefulset.yaml`** (those only hold controller-level fields). After editing `_pod.tpl`, confirm the Deployment render is unchanged with a `helm template` before/after diff.

**After every change to the WordPress chart, run the verify script before committing:**

```bash
./charts/wordpress/samples/verify/verify.sh
```

This script installs the chart via `install.sh`, waits for all pods (WordPress, MariaDB, Valkey) to become Ready, checks init-container and main-container logs for errors, and runs HTTP + metrics smoke tests. Fix any reported failures before pushing. Clean up afterwards with:

```bash
./charts/wordpress/samples/verify/uninstall.sh
```

## WireGuard and wg-easy charts

Both charts require a namespace with `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged` (see each chart's `readme.md` "Prerequisites" section).

**After every change to the wireguard or wg-easy chart, run the matching verify script before committing:**

```bash
./charts/wireguard/samples/verify/verify.sh
./charts/wg-easy/samples/verify/verify.sh
```

Each script installs the chart via `install.sh` into a dedicated `*-verify` namespace, waits for the pod to become Ready, checks container logs for errors, verifies the `wg0` interface comes up (and for wireguard, that `wg show` reports the expected listening port and peer count), and smoke-tests the Service(s)/NodePort(s). Fix any reported failures before pushing. Clean up afterwards with:

```bash
./charts/wireguard/samples/verify/uninstall.sh
./charts/wg-easy/samples/verify/uninstall.sh
```

> **Note:** wg-easy's verify currently fails on nftables-only kernels (e.g. Talos) due to an upstream wg-easy v15 image issue — see [charts/wg-easy/readme.md](charts/wg-easy/readme.md#known-issues). This is expected and not a chart regression.

# RTK (Rust Token Killer) - Token-Optimized Commands

## Golden Rule

**Always prefix commands with `rtk`**. If RTK has a dedicated filter, it uses it. If not, it passes through unchanged. This means RTK is always safe to use.

**Important**: Even in command chains with `&&`, use `rtk`:
```bash
# ❌ Wrong
git add . && git commit -m "msg" && git push

# ✅ Correct
rtk git add . && rtk git commit -m "msg" && rtk git push
```
